Subject: Catching Up on Missed Work

Dear [Teacher's Name],

I am writing to let you know that I was unable to attend class on [date] due to illness. I am sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused and I will make sure to catch up on any missed work as soon as possible.

I have already contacted a classmate to get a copy of the notes and any handouts that were distributed during class. I will also review the material covered in class on my own and complete any assigned homework or reading.

If there is any additional work that I need to complete or any other way that I can make up for the missed class, please let me know. I am committed to staying on track with the coursework and I do not want my absence to negatively impact my grade.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Sincerely,
Saaransh Shrivastava
