Subject: Request for Sick Leave

Dear Principal,

I am writing to inform you that I am unable to attend school today due to illness. I woke up this morning feeling unwell and after consulting with a doctor, it has been determined that I need to take the day off to rest and recover.

I am sorry for any inconvenience this may cause and I will make sure to catch up on any missed work as soon as I am feeling better. I will keep you updated on my progress and let you know as soon as I am able to return to school.

Thank you for your understanding and support during this time.

Sincerely,
Saaransh Shrivastava
