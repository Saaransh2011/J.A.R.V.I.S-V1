Dear [Recipient's Name],

I am writing to inform you that I am unable to come to work for the next few days due to illness. I woke up this morning with a high fever, severe body aches, and a persistent cough. I have seen a doctor and have been diagnosed with the flu.

I am currently taking medication and getting plenty of rest in order to recover quickly. However, I am unable to perform my duties effectively while I am sick. Therefore, I am requesting sick leave for the next three days, starting from [Start Date] to [End Date].

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and I will make sure to catch up on any missed work once I return to the office. If there is any additional information you need, please let me know.

Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
