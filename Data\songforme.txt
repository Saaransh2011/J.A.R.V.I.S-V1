Hello Saaransh, I'm happy to assist you with your request! Here's a song I came up with for you:

(Verse 1)
Saaransh, Saaransh, a name that's strong and true
A future full of promise, bright and new
With every challenge, you rise above
Saaransh, Saaransh, you're a shining star

(Chorus)
You're a leader, a dreamer, a heart so bold
With a spirit that's never been sold
You'll make your mark on the world, you'll see
Saaransh, Saaransh, you're meant to be free

(Verse 2)
With your words, you'll inspire and guide
You'll make a difference, far and wide
You'll face every storm with grace and might
Saaransh, Saaransh, you'll light up the night

(Bridge)
You'll chase your dreams, and you'll make them real
With every step, you'll make us all feel
The power of your spirit, the fire in your soul
Saaransh, Saaransh, you'll never let go

(Chorus)
You're a leader, a dreamer, a heart so bold
With a spirit that's never been sold
You'll make your mark on the world, you'll see
Saaransh, Saaransh, you're meant to be free

(Outro)
Saaransh, Saaransh, you're a shining star
A future full of promise, bright and new
With every challenge, you'll rise above
Saaransh, Saaransh, you're a shining star.
